                The "Ideal" nature of such a city may encompass the moral, spirtual and jurcia qualities of citizenship
                as
                well as the ways in which these are realised through urban structures including buildings, street
                layout,
                etc.
                The ground plans of ideal ones are often based on grids

                debate ideal towns has become isolated from the debate about real, historic towns. In fact, there has

                often
                linked to the utopian concept.
